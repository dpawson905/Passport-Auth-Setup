## Future Updates

- Use something like agenda to handle sending emails this will prevent us from having to delete the users account who attempted to register if sendgrid fails
- (PAID)Incorporate KickBox into the project... Kickbox is a module that will reach out and check to see if the email address is even valid. If not, halt the registration.
- (PAID)Use something like Twilio to send texts to users to confirm their account.
